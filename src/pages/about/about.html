        While there are many news aggregator sites for football and Celtic F.C. - I didn't want to provide just another
        one
        to the growing list of them. I want to provide one that is soley for Celtic fans; one that can be accessed from
        anywhere no matter the device our fans are using.
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to give as much power to the fans as possible, we all know
        very well the influence the mainstream media have so I am always trying to improve the way in which the fans can
        control what they chose to see and read.
